/**

 * Compute the Bessel function of the second kind, of order 1 of the

 * <h2>Inspiration</h2>
 * <p>
 * Some of the more complex mathematical routines in this package, such as
 * this class may have been inspired by &ndash; or derived from freely
 * available open source code in the internet (although this &quot;function
 * object&quot; idea is by a unique &quot;invention&quot; by myself).
 * Unfortunately, this has been a quite some time ago for personal use, so
 * I (<a href="mailto:tweise@gmx.de">Thomas Weise</a>) do not remember
 * anymore from where the original stems.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Also, most of the code has undergone quite a few revisions,
 * refactorings, and modifications, so it often is quite different from the
 * potential originals.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * I vaguely remember that some code may have been inspired by the <a
 * href="https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/">The Apache
 * Commons Mathematics Library</a>&nbsp;[<a href="#cite_A2013CMTACML"
 * style="font-weight:bold">1</a>] which is currently is licensed under <a
 * href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/">Apache License 2.0</a> which is
 * GPL compatible &ndash; but again, I am not sure anymore, it's too long
 * ago.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you know the original source of this code or find a very similar
 * package, please let me know so that I can properly cite it. If you feel
 * that this code here somehow infringes your copyright, please let me know
 * as well and I will cease putting it online or replace it with different
 * code.<br/>
 * Many thanks.<br/>
 * Thomas.
