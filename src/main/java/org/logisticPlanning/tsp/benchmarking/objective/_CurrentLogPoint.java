 * A {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.objective.LogPoint log
 * point} representing the current state of the optimization algorithm.
 * This log point is special by providing a {@link #getConsumedRuntime()}
 * function which uses {@link java.lang.System#currentTimeMillis()} to
 * compute the runtime that has passed and which additionally updates the
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.objective.ObjectiveFunction#shouldTerminate()
 * termination criterion} of the
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.objective.ObjectiveFunction
 * objective function}. Thus calling {@link #getConsumedRuntime()} of
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.objective.ObjectiveFunction#getCurrentLogPoint()
 * f.getCurrentLogPoint()} (where {@code f} is the objective function) is
 * costly and should only be performed when absolutely necessary, i.e.,
 * when real time is required.
