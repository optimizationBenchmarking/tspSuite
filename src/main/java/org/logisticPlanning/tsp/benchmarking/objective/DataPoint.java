/**
 *
 <p>
 * A data point is basically a de-serialized
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.objective.LogPoint
 * LogPoint}. Different from
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.objective.LogPoint
 * LogPoint}, it also provides the relative objective value (
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.objective.LogPoint#getBestF()
 * objective value} -
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.instances.Instance#optimum()
 * optimum})/optimum, the {@link #getConsumedNormalizedRuntime() normalized
 * consumed runtime}, and information regarding why the log point was
 * collection. These information are not available to the optimization
 * processes, as such information would also not be known when solving an
 * unknown TSP problem. For evaluating the performance of an algorithm
 * after the run, they may be useful though.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.objective.LogPoint log
 * point} stores information about the best solution quality (in terms of
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.objective.ObjectiveFunction#evaluate(int[])
 * tour length}) that an optimization algorithm has achieved until a given
 * point in time. There are four measures that define the term &quot;point
 * in time&quot; which are supported by our benchmark environment:
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * The
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.objective.LogPoint#getConsumedRuntime()
 * actual time} that has passed in milliseconds. This is the most natural
 * measure, but it also has some drawbacks. First, the time can only be
 * measured efficiently up to a certain precision. Second, different
 * computers may execute the algorithm at different speeds, meaning that an
 * algorithm may seem to be good just because it was executed on a fast
 * machine. Third, not only the machine itself determines the speed of the
 * algorithm, but also stuff like the settings of the benchmark
 * environment. For example, for some problems the
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.dist.DistanceComputer
 * distance information} of the problem instance may be represented as
 * distance matrix (if the available memory permits it and the problem
 * dimension is reasonably small) and sometimes it may be represented as
 * coordinate list and distances are calculated on the fly. All in all, the
 * runtime measured will strongly depend on the machine and runtime
 * environment under which the experiment was carried out.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li id="logPointNormalizedRuntime">
 * <p>
 * <b>Not available at runtime:</b>&nbsp;The
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.objective.DataPoint#getConsumedNormalizedRuntime()
 * normalized time measure} tries to mitigate this effect: Before
 * performing an experiment, a
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.objective._SpeedBenchmark
 * standardized algorithm} (
 * <em>{@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.solving.algorithms.heuristics.doubleEndedNearestNeighbor.DoubleEndedNearestNeighborHeuristic double-ended nearest neighbor heuristic}</em>
 * &nbsp;[<a href="#cite_JMB1997TTSPACSILO" style="font-weight:bold">1</a>,
 * <a href="#cite_JMG2004EAOHFTS" style="font-weight:bold">2</a>]) is
 * applied to the problem instance (in the same environment and with the
 * same settings) and the time it needs is measured. The actual runtime of
 * the algorithm that we want to benchmark is then divided (normalized) by
 * this factor. Since the standardized algorithm is also a TSP solver and
 * has the same complexity ( <code>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</code>) as many simple
 * heuristics, this normalization process leads to time measurements that
 * are reasonably well comparable over different platforms. Another
 * advantage of this metric is that it automatically &quot;scales&quot;
 * with the problem size. (This information is only available to the
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.objective.DataPoint
 * post-processing} and not online for the running algorithm.)
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * The
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.objective.LogPoint#getConsumedFEs()
 * total number} of solutions constructed so far, i.e., the number of
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.objective.ObjectiveFunction#evaluate(int[])
 * objective function evaluations} (FEs) used up by the algorithm to get
 * the solution. This metric is independent of the speed of the computer,
 * which is both good (algorithms executed on fast computers have no
 * a-priori advantage) and bad (we do not know how much overhead
 * calculations an algorithm performs in order to construct a solution
 * before evaluating it). The latter means that algorithms may need a very
 * different amount of time to perform one function evaluation even on the
 * same computer. Obviously, we do not want to have algorithms that can
 * find good solutions with few FEs and in short time.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * The
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.objective.LogPoint#getConsumedDEs()
 * total number} of calls to the
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.objective.ObjectiveFunction#distance(int, int)
 * distance function} which computes the distance between two points/cities
 * (DEs). Normally, we assume that evaluating one candidate solution takes
 * <code>{@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.objective.ObjectiveFunction#n() n}</code>
 * DEs, where <code>n</code> is the number of nodes or cities in a TSP.
 * However, that may not be true. For example, if we have a candidate
 * solution (node permutation) of a given tour length and want to
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.solving.operators.permutation.update.PermutationUpdateOperator
 * modify} it, way maybe do not need to re-compute all the distances in the
 * solution but instead, only a few (
 * <code>{@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.solving.operators.permutation.update.PermutationUpdateOperator#delta(int[], org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.dist.DistanceComputer, int, int) O(1)}</code>
 * ) distances.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This metric therefore provides some form of measure for the overhead per
 * function evaluation. Furthermore, if we assume that computing the
 * distance between two nodes is costly &ndash; as it may be in a
 * real-world application &ndash; the DE metric gives us a very good
 * estimate of the runtime an algorithm needs to achieve a certain
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.objective.ObjectiveFunction#evaluate(int[])
 * solution quality}. The distance evaluations were also considered as
 * runtime measure in&nbsp;[<a href="#cite_B1990EATSP"
 * style="font-weight:bold">3</a>] (where instead evaluations of a
 * geometric analysis were used, which in general TSPs is not available).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The drawback of this approach is, however, that some algorithms
 * temporarily store distance and thus invoke the distance measure less
 * often. These algorithms then look very fast and may have an unreasonable
 * advantage. For proper benchmarking, we do not allow copying the distance
 * matrix, but it is often reasonable to allow the algorithms to store
 * {@code O(n)} or {@code O(n log n)} distances. If we would not allow
 * this, this would often force us to intentionally implement algorithms
 * inefficiently, which gives them an unfair disadvantage. The decision on
 * what distances are allowed to cache and which are not is a hard
 * decision.
