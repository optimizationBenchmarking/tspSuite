 * 
 This is the base class for TSP algorithms. <h2>Implementation Guide for
 * TSP Algorithms</h2>
 * <p id="implementingAnAlgorithm">
 * The TSP algorithm evaluation framework provides automation for most of
 * the steps necessary to conduct an experiment. It will, for example,
 * automatically apply your algorithm to several benchmark sets,
 * automatically in parallel with as many CPUs you have available, and
 * store its results in files. In order to use these features, there are a
 * set of implementation requirements that must be followed. We discuss
 * them in the following.
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Your algorithm must be implemented as subclass of the class
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.solving.TSPAlgorithm TSPAlgorithm} and
 * override the method
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.solving.TSPAlgorithm#solve(org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.objective.ObjectiveFunction)
 * solve(ObjectiveFunction)}. This method is where you must put your
 * algorithm implementation. It has no return value, since the
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.objective.ObjectiveFunction
 * ObjectiveFunction} will collect all information (including your solution
 * and the objective values) automatically. At the same time, the
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.objective.ObjectiveFunction
 * ObjectiveFunction} is also the source of all information for your
 * algorithm. It provides you, e.g., the the
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.objective.ObjectiveFunction#n()
 * number} of cities in the TSP, the
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.objective.ObjectiveFunction#distance(int, int)
 * distance} between two cities, and ways to evaluate the total distance of
 * a tour represented as
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.objective.ObjectiveFunction#evaluate(int[])
 * city permutation} or
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.objective.ObjectiveFunction#evaluateAdj(int[])
 * adjacency list}, amongst others.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Some example algorithm implementations can be found
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.solving.algorithms.localSearch.permutation.hc.UpdatingPermutationHillClimber
 * here},
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.solving.algorithms.localSearch.permutation.vns.PermutationRNS
 * here}, and
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.solving.algorithms.metaheuristics.permutation.paco.PACO
 * here}.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.solving.TSPAlgorithm TSPAlgorithm} has a
 * constructor which takes a {@link java.lang.String String} holding the
 * algorithm name as parameter. Your own algorithm class must implement a
 * public zero-parameter constructor. This constructor must call the
 * inherited constructor and supply the name. The name can contain spaces
 * and should be the same name that you would also use in a paper or other
 * document for your algorithm. For example &quot;
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.solving.algorithms.heuristics.doubleEndedNearestNeighbor.DoubleEndedNearestNeighborHeuristic
 * Double-Ended Nearest Neighbor Heuristic}&quot; is such a name.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * The benchmark environment supports multi-threading, i.e., it will
 * execute as many runs in parallel as possible (1 thread per CPU), in
 * order to speed up the experiment. However,
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.solving.TSPAlgorithm algorithms} do not
 * need to be thread-safe (and
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.objective.ObjectiveFunction
 * objective functions} are not anyway). One instance of your algorithm
 * will always and only be accessed/executed by one single thread.
 * </p>
 * <p id="cloneAlgo">
 * This is possible by first creating one instance of your algorithm and
 * then {@link java.lang.Object#clone() cloning} it for each thread. On one
 * hand, you do not need to take care of synchronization (and we do not
 * waste runtime for such stuff). On the other hand, this also means that
 * you need to take good care of member variables and copy them by
 * overriding the {@link org.logisticPlanning.utils.NamedObject#clone()
 * clone method}. If your algorithm stores mutable objects as member
 * variables, then you must also clone them properly. Otherwise, the
 * instances of your algorithm that run in parallel will work on the same
 * data structures and produce corrupt results.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It is common that your algorithm may hold a member variable of type,
 * say, {@code double[]}, to avoid memory allocation in subsequent runs.
 * When cloning, this variable must be set to either {@code null} in the
 * clone or cloned as well. Otherwise, both algorithm instances (the
 * original and the clone) will point to the same array, use it in
 * parallel, and wreck havoc. Zounds! The same holds for any references to
 * objects or sub-algorithms that your method uses. As soon as these
 * objects are mutable or may hold variables that may change, you must
 * clone them as well.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Some examples for cloneable algorithms are given
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.solving.algorithms.localSearch.permutation.hc.UpdatingPermutationHillClimber#clone()
 * here},
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.solving.algorithms.localSearch.permutation.multiNeighborhoodSearch.MultiNeighborhoodSearch#clone()
 * here}, and
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.solving.algorithms.metaheuristics.permutation.paco.PACO#clone()
 * here}.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Many algorithms have parameters. An
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.solving.algorithms.metaheuristics.general.ea.EA}
 * may have a
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.solving.algorithms.metaheuristics.general.ea.EA#setCrossoverRate(double)
 * crossover rate}, the
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.solving.algorithms.metaheuristics.permutation.paco.PACO
 * population-based ACO} algorithm has an
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.solving.algorithms.metaheuristics.permutation.paco.PACO#setAlpha(double)
 * alpha} and a
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.solving.algorithms.metaheuristics.permutation.paco.PACO#setBeta(double)
 * beta} parameter, for instance. Our framework provides the ability of
 * setubg algorithm parameters via the command line or an ini-file and to
 * log these parameter values into the log files automatically. This is
 * very useful, as the algorithm settings should always be part of the
 * experiment documentation and this way, that is ensured automatically.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In order to make use of this facility, you should override the following
 * three methods, which are inherited from the class
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.utils.config.Configurable Configurable}:
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.utils.config.Configurable#printParameters(java.io.PrintStream)
 * printParameters} should print &quot;parameter-name
 * parameter-description&quot; pairs to the {@link java.io.PrintStream
 * PrintStream} that it gets as parameter. The user can invoke the
 * benchmarker with the {@code -help} command line option and will then get
 * this information displayed. You must always call the
 * super-implementation of this method before executing own code.</li>
 * <li>The method
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.utils.config.Configurable#printConfiguration(java.io.PrintStream)
 * printConfiguration}, too, gets a {@link java.io.PrintStream PrintStream}
 * as parameter. It prints the configuration of the object to that stream
 * in form of &quot;parameter-name parameter-value&quot; pairs. This method
 * is called by the benchmarking environment when the log files are
 * written. You must always call the super-implementation of this method
 * before executing own code.</li>
 * <li id="overrideConfigure">
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.utils.config.Configurable#configure(org.logisticPlanning.utils.config.Configuration)
 * configure} receives an instance of the class
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.utils.config.Configuration Configuration}.
 * This class has loaded all parameters from the command line (and possible
 * ini-files) and provides several convenient methods to access them, e.g.,
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.utils.config.Configuration#getString(String, String)
 * getString},
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.utils.config.Configuration#getFile(String, java.io.File)
 * getFile}, and
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.utils.config.Configuration#getLong(String, long, long, long)
 * getLing}, each taking a parameter name, a default values (and possible
 * valid range limits) as parameter and returning a value of the type
 * implied by their name. You must always call the super-implementation of
 * this method before executing own code in order to set the parameters of
 * your algorithm.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Some examples for configurable algorithms are given
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.solving.algorithms.metaheuristics.general.ea.EA
 * here},
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.solving.algorithms.localSearch.permutation.multiNeighborhoodSearch.MultiNeighborhoodSearch
 * here}, and
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.solving.algorithms.metaheuristics.permutation.paco.PACO
 * here}.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Starting at version 0.9.8 of TSP Suite, we provide run-depending
 * initialization and finalization support for algorithms and algorithm
 * modules. The new class
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.solving.TSPModule} is introduced as
 * base-class for all algorithm modules (such as
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.solving.operators.Operator search
 * operators} or {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.solving.gpm.GPM
 * genotype-phenotype mappings}) and the
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.solving.TSPAlgorithm TSP algorithms}
 * themselves. This new class provides two methods,
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.solving.TSPModule#beginRun(org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.objective.ObjectiveFunction)}
 * and
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.solving.TSPModule#endRun(org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.objective.ObjectiveFunction)}
 * which must be called before and after a run, respectively. Each
 * algorithm module must then invoke them recursively for all of its
 * sub-components. The new method
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.solving.TSPAlgorithm#call(org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.objective.ObjectiveFunction)}
 * now acts as a wrapper for
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.solving.TSPAlgorithm#solve(org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.objective.ObjectiveFunction)}
 * and invokes them. This allows for a more targeted allocation and
 * de-allocation of data structures for each run.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p id="MyHeuristic">
 * The last step is to provide a {@code main} method which invokes the
 * benchmarking system on your algorithm class. Assume that your class has
 * the name {@code MyHeuristic}, usually it would contain a method
 * {@code main} as given <a href="#invokeMyHeuristic">below</a>,

 * In the <a href="#invokeMyHeuristic">above example</a>, the

 * as parameter of the method
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.solving.TSPAlgorithmRunner#benchmark(org.logisticPlanning.utils.collections.lists.ArrayListView, java.lang.Class, java.lang.String[])

 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The second parameter of that method is the class of your algorithm

 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.solving.TSPAlgorithm TSPAlgorithm}), and
 * the third parameter is the array of command line arguments that has been
 * passed to your program (this will be used to construct the
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.utils.config.Configuration Configuration}
 * instance to be handed to your algorithm's
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.utils.config.Configurable#configure(org.logisticPlanning.utils.config.Configuration)

 * <p>
 * Once invoked, the
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.solving.TSPAlgorithmRunner#benchmark(org.logisticPlanning.utils.collections.lists.ArrayListView, java.lang.Class, java.lang.String[])

 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.utils.config.Configuration Configuration}
 * instance to be handed to your algorithm's
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.utils.config.Configurable#configure(org.logisticPlanning.utils.config.Configuration)
 * configure} it, and create one {@link java.lang.Object#clone() clone} of
 * the configured instance for each available processor. It then
 * step-by-step loads one
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.instances.Instance problem
 * instance} after the other and applies the algorithm. Each clone of your
 * algorithm will perform a separate run in a separate thread, receiving a
 * separate instance of
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.objective.ObjectiveFunction
 * ObjectiveFunction}. Once a run is completed, the log information is
 * written to the log file, along with your algorithm's
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.utils.config.Configurable#printConfiguration(java.io.PrintStream)
 * configuration}.

 * </li>
 * <li id="testingTheAlgorithm">
 * <p>
 * Along with our benchmark code, we also provide a <a
 * href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing">unit testing</a>
 * facility based on <a href="http://www.junit.org/">JUnit</a>&nbsp;[<a
 * href="#cite_B2009JPG" style="font-weight:bold">5</a>, <a
 * href="#cite_RS2005JRPMFPT" style="font-weight:bold">6</a>, <a
 * href="#cite_MH2004JIA" style="font-weight:bold">7</a>]. It is strongly
 * recommended that you run tests with your algorithm before doing real
 * experiments. Of course, our testing facility cannot decide whether your
 * algorithm is right or wrong, but it may be able to detect some
 * programming mistakes. (The current version cannot check if there are
 * concurrency-related errors, resulting from a missing or faulty cloning
 * method, see <a href="#cloneAlgo">here</a>).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can easily create a unit test for your algorithm by extending the
 * class
 * {@link test.junit.org.logisticPlanning.tsp.solving.algorithms.TSPAlgorithmSymmetricTest
 * TSPAlgorithmSymmetricTest} if your algorithm can only solve
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.instances.Instance#SYMMETRIC_INSTANCES
 * symmetric} TSP instances and

 * <p>
 * This way of making use of a multi-threaded environment, by doing as many
 * runs with separate copies of an algorithm, is more efficient than
 * starting several instances of the benchmarking process in parallel
 * (which still is possible). The reason is that the runs being performed
 * in parallel may share the same distance computers, as distance computers
 * are immutable and we therefore can save both memory and improve caching.
 * </p>
 * <h2>Running Experiments</h2>
 * <p id="runningExperiments">
 * So you have implemented <em>and tested</em> your algorithm (let's call
 * it again {@code MyHeuristic}). The <em>TSP Suite</em> system can
 * automatically run experiments with it. More precisely, it can
 * automatically apply the algorithm to the problem instance from the
 * well-known <a
 * href="http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/"
 * >TSPLib</a>&nbsp;[<a href="#cite_DACO1995TSPLIB"
 * style="font-weight:bold">1</a>, <a href="#cite_R1995T9"
 * style="font-weight:bold">2</a>, <a href="#cite_R1991ATSPL"
 * style="font-weight:bold">3</a>, <a href="#cite_W2003ROCFTB"
 * style="font-weight:bold">4</a>] benchmark set. During such an
 * experiment, your algorithm will be applied to each of the symmetric
 * instances of this benchmark set (and also the asymmetric ones, if you
 * have specified that in the <a href="#invokeMyHeuristic">main</a> method)
 * for <code>30</code> independent trials taking up to one hour each (under
 * default settings).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The general way to conduct an experiment is as follows:
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 * <li id="makeAlgorithmJar">
 * <p>
 * Generate a {@code jar} archive including your algorithms code. Let's say
 * you called your archive {@code myHeuristicJar.jar}. If you are using <a
 * href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>&nbsp;[<a href="#cite_ECLIPSE"
 * style="font-weight:bold">8</a>], you could do that as follows:
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 * <li>Right-click on your project in Eclipse's package view.</li>
 * <li>Choose point &quot;Export&uot; in the pop-up menu coming up.</li>
 * <li>In the dialog that emerges select &quot;JAR file&quot; (under folder
 * &quot;Java&quot;).</li>
 * <li>Click &quot;next&quot;</li>
 * <li>In the new dialog, make sure that your project is selected as well
 * as all <em>sources of the TSP Suite.</em></li>
 * <li>Check the boxes &quot;Export generated class files and
 * resources&quot; and &quot;Export Java source files and resources&quot;.</li>
 * <li>In input line &quot;JAR file,&quot; select a path and file name
 * where you want your {@code jar} to emerge (e.g., a new folder and
 * <code id="myHeuristicJar">myHeuristicJar.jar</code>). Make sure the file
 * name ends with {@code .jar}.</li>
 * <li>Click &quot;Next&quot;.</li>
 * <li>Click &quot;Next&quot; (again).</li>
 * <li>Next to the input line for &quot;Main class,&quot; click
 * &quot;Browse&quot;.</li>
 * <li>In the dialog that pops up, select your algorithm's class (
 * {@code MyHeuristic}) and click &quot;OK&quot;.</li>
 * <li>Click &quot;Finish&quot; (again).</li>
 * <li>Congratulations: you have created a single binary holding your
 * algorithm implementation. This binary holds not only your project's
 * compiled class files, but also the source code. We suggest that you
 * store it together with the benchmarking results that you will obtain
 * with our system, since it is basically a part of your experiment's
 * documentation.</li>
 * </ol>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * You can now run the experiments with your program by executing the
 * {@code jar} archive from the command line with the command
 * {@code java -jar myHeuristicJar.jar}.
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 * <li>Please check the <a href="#jarCommandLine">command line
 * parameters</a> that you can supply to the benchmarking system.</li>
 * <li>If you have overridden the
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.utils.config.Configurable#configure(org.logisticPlanning.utils.config.Configuration)
 * configure} method in your algorithm class in order to <a
 * href="#overrideConfigure">expose its parameters</a> to the command line,
 * well, you should pass them through the command line as well.</li>
 * <li>You should run the experiments on a powerful machine with many
 * processors that you do not need for other stuff for, say, a week, since
 * they will take quite some time to run.</li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * If you set many parameter values, you can store them in an configuration
 * file as {@code key=value} pairs. If the configuration file's name is
 * {@code myConfigFile.txt}, then you would pass the command line parameter
 * &quot;
 * <code>{@link org.logisticPlanning.utils.config.Configuration#PARAM_PROPERTY_FILE configFile}=myConfigFile.txt</code>
 * &quot;. Then, all parameters in {@code configFile.txt} will be treated
 * as if they were directly provided through the command line.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ol>
 * </li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * That's it. Now your experiments are running!
 * </p>
 * <h2>Parallel and Distributed Benchmarking</h2>
 * <p>
 * Please be aware that the experiments may take quite some time. Ideally,
 * you should run them on a strong computer with many processors that you
 * do not need to touch for about a week&hellip; &hellip;and after that,
 * you will have a nice set of log files. In order to speed up the process,
 * we provide parallelization and distribution support for experimentation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Benchmarking is done by (potentially) multiple threads. Each thread does
 * the following: It iterates through the list of benchmarking instances
 * (from the <a
 * href="http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/"
 * >TSPLib</a>). For each benchmark instance it will define an output
 * folder of the corresponding name inside the overall output folder &quot;
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.objective.Benchmark#PARAM_DEST_DIR
 * outputDir}&quot;. It will now iterate through the runs that should be
 * done, from <code>1</code> to
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.objective.Benchmark#PARAM_MAX_RUNS
 * maxRuns}, where <code>maxRuns</code> is 30, by default. Each combination
 * of benchmark instance and run index defines a unique path and file name.
 * The thread tries to create the file with the corresponding name with the
 * {@link java.io.File#createNewFile()} which reports <code>true</code> if
 * a new file was created and <code>false</code> if the file already
 * existed. If the thread managed to create the file as &quot;new&quot;, it
 * will immediately begin to perform the run and after the run is finished,
 * store its results into the file. If the file already existed, the thread
 * will just move to the next run index. If the run index reaches
 * <code>maxRuns</code>, it moves to the next benchmark instance.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This mechanism allows the most primitive and yet surprisingly robust way
 * to enable parallelization, distribution, and restarting of experiments.
 * For instance, amongst the threads in a single
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.solving.TSPAlgorithmRunner process}, no
 * communication is necessary. Each thread will automatically find the next
 * run it should perform and no two threads may try to do the same work.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Distribution, e.g., when executing the experiments in a cluster, can be
 * achieved the same way: You only need to let their
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.objective.Benchmark#PARAM_DEST_DIR
 * outputDir} parameters point to the same <em>shared</em> folder. This
 * way, it is possible to let 3 computers with 24 threads each work on the
 * same experiment. Since there are about 110 benchmarking instances for
 * symmetric problems, the total required runtime for a symmetric TSP
 * solver could be reduced to 110 * 30 * 1 hour divided by 3 * 24, i.e., to
 * about two days (unless the solver can solve some problems in less than
 * an hour, in which case the time would be less, too).
 * </p>
 * <p id="restart">
 * Restarting experiments is also easy because of this mechanism: A
 * completed run will have an associated log file of non-zero size. Since
 * the log information is only written once the run is completed (in order
 * to not bias the time measurements), all runs that have been started but
 * are incomplete will have log files of zero size. Thus, if your computer
 * crashes or something, just delete all zero-sized files and you can
 * restart the benchmarker. It will resume its work and not repeat work
 * that has already been done. Under <a
 * href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a>, you could do
 * something like
 * <code>find&nbsp;~/{@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.objective.Benchmark#PARAM_DEST_DIR outputDir}/&nbsp;-type&nbsp;f&nbsp;-empty&nbsp;-delete</code>
 * or

 * <h2>Command Line Parameters of the Benchmarking Environment</h2>
 * <p id="jarCommandLine">
 * The benchmarking environment and running can be parameterized via
 * command line or config files. The following parameters are supported:
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * If &quot;
 * <code>{@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.solving.TSPAlgorithmRunner#PARAM_MAX_THREADS maxThreads}=nnn</code>
 * &quot; is supplied, then the benchmarker will use at most {@code nnn}
 * threads. Otherwise, it will use one thread per available processor.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * If &quot;
 * <code>{@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.objective.Benchmark#PARAM_DEST_DIR outputDir}=dir</code>
 * &quot; is set, the output of the program, i.e., the log files, will be
 * written to the directory {@code dir}. Otherwise, they will be written to
 * the current directory. Generally, the benchmarking environment will
 * automatically create a directory structure which allows us to easily
 * distinguish symmetric and asymmetric TSPs and log files for different
 * problem instances.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * If you pass the arguments &quot;
 * <code>-{@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.solving.TSPAlgorithmRunner#PARAM_RUNNER_LOGGER algoLogger}="global";ALL</code>
 * &quot;, you will receive logging information about the benchmarking
 * progress.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * You may pass in parameters like &quot;
 * <code>{@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.objective.CreatorInfo#PARAM_RESEARCHER_NAME researcherName}=&quot;first name last name&quot;</code>
 * &quot; to have your name in the log files (see class
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.objective.CreatorInfo
 * CreatorInfo} for more author-related parameters).
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * If &quot;
 * <code>{@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.solving.TSPAlgorithmRunner#PARAM_DET_INIT_CLASS initclass}=fullyQualifiedClassName</code>
 * &quot; is supplied, then the benchmarker will automatically instantiate
 * the class {@code fullyQualifiedClassName},
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.utils.config.Configurable#configure(org.logisticPlanning.utils.config.Configuration)
 * configure} it, and apply it as
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.objective.ObjectiveFunction#beginDeterministicInitialization(org.logisticPlanning.utils.NamedObject)
 * deterministic initialization procedure} to each instance before invoking
 * your algorithm. The result of this procedure is then available to your
 * algorithm via the
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.objective.ObjectiveFunction#getDeterministicInitializationLogPoint()
 * initialization log point} and
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.objective.ObjectiveFunction#getCopyOfBestAdj(int[])
 * getCopyOfBestAdj} or
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.objective.ObjectiveFunction#getCopyOfBest(int[])
 * getCopyOfBest} at startup (the data provided by the latter two methods
 * will obviously change during the algorithm run). If this parameter is
 * not provided, no such deterministic initialization will be performed.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A deterministic initialization procedure is often useful to start your
 * algorithm with a reasonably good approximation of the solution. This is
 * especially often done in local search methods, that usually often invoke
 * a {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.solving.algorithms.heuristics
 * heuristic}. Due to this command line parameter, you do not need to
 * hard-code the choice of that algorithm in your program and instead
 * comfortably test it with different heuristics. Also, this allows us to
 * do some runtime optimization: As a deterministic initializer should
 * always return the same result, we need to compute that only once per
 * benchmark case and can re-use it for each run.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * The parameter &quot;
 * <code>{@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.objective.Benchmark#PARAM_MAX_RUNS maxRuns}=nnn</code>
 * &quot; can be provided to set the number of runs to be performed for
 * each benchmark case. The
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.objective.Benchmark#DEFAULT_MAX_RUNS
 * default value} is {@code 30}. I suggest to not change that value, i.e.,
 * to not provide this parameter.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * The parameter &quot;
 * <code>{@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.objective.Benchmark#PARAM_MAX_FES maxFEs}=nnn</code>
 * &quot; can be provided to set the maximum number {@code nnn} of
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.objective.LogPoint#getConsumedFEs()
 * function evaluations} to be performed for each benchmark run. The
 * default value is <code>100*n<sup>3</sup></code>, where {@code n} is the
 * number of cities of the benchmark cases. I suggest to not change that
 * value, i.e., to not provide this parameter.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * The parameter &quot;
 * <code>{@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.objective.Benchmark#PARAM_MAX_DES maxDEs}=nnn</code>
 * &quot; can be provided to set the maximum number {@code nnn} of
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.objective.LogPoint#getConsumedDEs()
 * distance evaluations} to be performed for each benchmark run. The
 * default value is <code>100*n<sup>4</sup></code>, where {@code n} is the
 * number of cities of the benchmark cases. I suggest to not change that
 * value, i.e., to not provide this parameter.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * The parameter &quot;
 * <code>{@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.objective.Benchmark#PARAM_MAX_TIME maxTime}=nnn</code>
 * &quot; can be provided to set the maximum runtime, specified as maximum
 * number {@code nnn} of
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.objective.LogPoint#getConsumedRuntime()
 * milliseconds} that a benchmark run may take. The default value is
 * {@link org.logisticPlanning.tsp.benchmarking.objective.Benchmark#DEFAULT_MAX_TIME_PER_RUN
 * 3600000}, i.e., one hour. I suggest to not change that value, i.e., to

 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * If you set many parameter values, you can store them in an configuration
 * file as {@code key=value} pairs. If the configuration file's name is
 * {@code myConfigFile.txt}, then you would pass the command line parameter
 * &quot;
 * <code>{@link org.logisticPlanning.utils.config.Configuration#PARAM_PROPERTY_FILE configFile}=myConfigFile.txt</code>

   * ">experimentation facility</a> to obtain an algorithm instance for
   * each available processor (thread). These instances are then used to
   * execute independent algorithm runs in parallel. This means that, if
   * your algorithm has an internal variable of type, say, {@code int[]},
   * this method here should either also clone it or set it to {@code null}
   * (to indicate that it should be initialized when used next). If you do
   * not do this, your algorithm instances will actually share the same
   * variables. Since they will access them in parallel, the results may be
   * unpredictable. The same problem holds for any references to objects or
   * sub-algorithms that your method uses. As soon as these objects are
   * mutable or may hold variables that may change, you must clone them as
   * well.
   * 
   * @return a cloned instance of this algorithm, with the same
   *         configuration but distinct data variables and buffers
